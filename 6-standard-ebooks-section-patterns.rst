################################
Standard Ebooks Section Patterns
################################

All Standard Ebooks set of sections that are included in each ebook, and which are usually generated from template files. These sections include sections like the titlepage, imprint, and Uncopyright.

The title string
****************

The title string is a sentence listing the title of the ebook, its author, and any other contributors. It is used in various Standard Ebooks template files.

#.	The title string is formed with the following algorithm.

	-	Start with an empty string.

	-	Append the title of the work, without any subtitles.

	-	Append :string:`, by`, then the author. If there are two authors, separate them with :string:`and`. If there are three or more authors, each one is separated by :string:`,`, and the final one is preceded by :string:`, and`.

	-	If there is a translator, append :string:`. Translated by`, then the translator name. Multiple translators are handled in the same manner as multiple authors.

	-	If there is an illustrator, append :string:`. Illustrated by`, then the illustrator name. Multiple illustrators are handled in the same manner as multiple authors.

#.	While the title string may contain periods, it never ends in a period.

The table of contents
*********************

The table of contents (the ToC) is not viewable as a page in the ebook’s reading order. Instead, the reader’s ereading system displays the ToC as part of its reading interface.

These rules outline how to structure the ToC. Typically, the :bash:`se print-toc` tool constructs the ToC according to these rules, without further changes being necessary.

The :html:`<nav>` element
=============================

#.	The first child of the ToC’s :html:`<body>` element is a :html:`<nav>` element with the semantic inflection :value:`toc`.

#.	The first child of the :html:`<nav>` element is a :html:`<h2 epub:type="title">Table of Contents</h2>` element.

#.	The second child of the :html:`<nav>` element is an :html:`<ol>` element representing the items in the Table of Contents.

The top-level :html:`<ol>` element
----------------------------------

The :html:`<nav>` element’s top-level :html:`<ol>` element contains a list of items in the Table of Contents.

#.	The first child is a link to the titlepage.

	.. code:: html

		<li>
			<a href="text/titlepage.xhtml">Titlepage</a>
		</li>

#.	The second child is a link to the imprint.

	.. code:: html

		<li>
			<a href="text/imprint.xhtml">Imprint</a>
		</li>

#.	The second-to-last child is a link to the colophon.

	.. code:: html

		<li>
			<a href="text/colophon.xhtml">Colophon</a>
		</li>

#.	The second-to-last child is a link to the Uncopyright.

	.. code:: html

		<li>
			<a href="text/uncopyright.xhtml">Uncopyright</a>
		</li>

#.	In books with half title pages, the half title page is listed in the ToC and the next sibling is an :html:`<ol>` element containing the book’s contents.

	.. code:: html

		<li>
			<a href="text/halftitle.xhtml">The Moon Pool</a>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<a href="text/chapter-1.xhtml"><span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>: The Thing on the Moon Path</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="text/chapter-2.xhtml"><span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>: “Dead! All Dead!”</a>
				</li>

:html:`<li>` descendents
------------------------

#.	Each :html:`<li>` contains an :html:`<a>` element pointing to a file or hash, and optionally also contains an :html:`<ol>` element representing a nested series of ToC items.

#.	If an :html:`<li>` element contains a nested :html:`<ol>` element, that :html:`<li>`’s first child is an :html:`<a>` element that points to the beginning of that section.

	.. code:: html

		<li>
			<a href="text/halftitle.xhtml">Sybil</a>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<a href="text/book-1.xhtml">Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span></a>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<a href="text/chapter-1-1.xhtml" epub:type="z3998:roman">I</a>
						</li>

#.	Roman numerals in the ToC have the semantic inflection of :value:`z3998:roman`. A :html:`<span>` element is included if the entire contents of the :html:`<a>` element are not a Roman numeral.

	.. class:: wrong

		.. code:: html

			<li>
				<a href="text/chapter-1.xhtml">I</a>
			</li>

	.. class:: wrong

		.. code:: html

			<li>
				<a href="text/chapter-1.xhtml"><span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span></a>
			</li>

	.. class:: corrected

		.. code:: html

			<li>
				<a href="text/chapter-1.xhtml" epub:type="z3998:roman">I</a>
			</li>

	.. class:: corrected

		.. code:: html

			<li>
				<a href="text/book-1.xhtml">Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span></a>
				<ol>
					...
				</ol>
			</li>

:html:`<a>` descendents
-----------------------

#.	The :value:`title`, :value:`subtitle`, :value:`ordinal`, and any `related title epub semantics <https://idpf.github.io/epub-vocabs/structure/#titles>`__ are not included in ToC entries. Their usage context is only within actual heading content.

#.	The text of the :html:`<a>` element is decided as follows:

	1.	If there is no :html:`<hgroup>` in the section, the text becomes the inner XHTML of the top :html:`<h1>`–:html:`<h6>` element with any of the above semantics removed.

	2.	If there is an :html:`<hgroup>` element:

		1.	If the :html:`<hgroup>`’s closest parent :html:`<section>` or :html:`<article>` has an :html:`epub:type` value of :value:`part`, :value:`division`, or :value:`volume`, then keep all :html:`<hgroup>` children.

		2.	Otherwise, if the :html:`<hgroup>`’s closest parent :html:`<section>` or :html:`<article>` has an :html:`epub:type` value of :value:`halftitlepage`, or if the first child of the :html:`<hgroup>` has the :value:`title` semantic, then discard any children with the :value:`subtitle` semantic.

		3.	Then, the text becomes the inner XHTML of the first :html:`<hgroup>` child. If there is a second child, append a colon and space to the text, then the inner XHTML of the second child. The above semantics are then removed.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: html

	<article id="a-daughter-of-albion" epub:type="se:short-story">
		<h2 epub:type="title">A Daughter of Albion</h2>
		<p>...</p>
	</article>

Result: :html:`A Daughter of Albion`

.. code:: html

	<section id="book-1" epub:type="part">
		<hgroup>
			<h2><span epub:type="label">Book <span epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">I</span></h2>
			<h3 epub:type="title">The Coming of the Martians</h3>
		</hgroup>
		<p>...</p>
	</section>

Result: :html:`Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>: The Coming of the Martians`

.. code:: html

	<section id="chapter-1" epub:type="chapter">
		<hgroup>
			<h2 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">I</h2>
			<h3 epub:type="title">A Fellow Traveller</h3>
		</hgroup>
		<p>...</p>
	</section>

Result: :html:`<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>: A Fellow Traveller`

.. code:: html

	<section id="epilogue" epub:type="epilogue">
		<hgroup>
			<h3 epub:type="title">Epilogue</h3>
			<h4 epub:type="subtitle">A Morning Call</h4>
		</hgroup>
		<p>...</p>
	</section>

Result: :html:`Epilogue`

The landmarks :html:`<nav>` element
===================================

After the first :html:`<nav>` element, there is a second :html:`<nav>` element with the semantic inflection of :value:`landmarks`.

#.	The first child is an :html:`<h2 epub:type="title">Landmarks</h2>` element.

#.	The second child is an :html:`<ol>` element listing the major structural divisions of the book.

:html:`<li>` descendents
------------------------

Each :html:`<li>` element contains a link to one of the major structural divisions of the book. In general, a structural division is any section of the book that is not part of the body text, plus one element representing the beginning of the body text.

#.	Each :html:`<li>` element has the computed semantic inflection of top-level :html:`<section>` element in the file. The computed semantic inflection includes inherited semantic inflection from the :html:`<body>` element.

	.. code:: html

		<li>
			<a href="text/preface.xhtml" epub:type="frontmatter preface">Preface</a>
		</li>

#.	The body text, as a single unit regardless of internal divisions, is represented by a link to the first file of the body text. In a prose novel, this is usually Chapter 1 or Part 1. In a collection this is usually the first item, like the first short story in a short story collection. The text is the title of the work as represented in the metadata :html:`<dc:title>` element.

	.. code:: html

		<li>
			<a href="text/book-1.xhtml" epub:type="bodymatter z3998:fiction">Sybil</a>
		</li>

	.. code:: html

		<li>
			<a href="text/chapter-1.xhtml" epub:type="bodymatter z3998:fiction">The Moon Pool</a>
		</li>

	.. code:: html

		<li>
			<a href="text/the-adventure-of-wisteria-lodge.xhtml" epub:type="bodymatter z3998:fiction">His Last Bow</a>
		</li>

The titlepage
*************

#.	The Standard Ebooks titlepage is the first item in the ebook’s content flow. Standard Ebooks do not have a separate cover page file within the content flow.

#.	The title page has a :html:`<title>` element with the value :string:`Titlepage`.

#.	The titlepage contains one :html:`<section id="titlepage" epub:type="titlepage">` element which in turn contains one :html:`<img src="../images/titlepage.svg">` element.

#.	The :html:`<img>` element has its :html:`alt` attribute set to :string:`The titlepage for the Standard Ebooks edition of TITLE_STRING`, where :string:`TITLE_STRING` is the `Standard Ebooks title string </manual/VERSION/6-standard-ebooks-section-patterns#6.1>`__ for the ebook.

#.	A complete titlepage looks like the following template:

	.. code:: html

		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
		<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:prefix="z3998: http://www.daisy.org/z3998/2012/vocab/structure/, se: https://standardebooks.org/vocab/1.0" xml:lang="en-US">
			<head>
				<title>Titlepage</title>
				<link href="../css/core.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
				<link href="../css/local.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
			</head>
			<body epub:type="frontmatter">
				<section id="titlepage" epub:type="titlepage">
					<img alt="The titlepage for the Standard Ebooks edition of TITLE_STRING" src="../images/titlepage.svg" epub:type="se:color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</section>
			</body>
		</html>

The imprint
***********

#.	The Standard Ebooks imprint is the second item in the ebook’s content flow.

#.	The imprint has a :html:`<title>` element with the value :string:`Imprint`.

#.	The imprint contains one :html:`<section id="imprint" epub:type="imprint">` element, which in turn contains one :html:`<header>` element with the Standard Ebooks logo, followed by a series of :html:`<p>` elements containing the imprint’s content.

#.	The second :html:`<p>` element contains links to the online transcription that the ebook is based off of, followed by a link to the online page scans used to proof against.

	#.	While the template lists Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive as the default sources for transcriptions and scans, these may be adjusted to the specific sources used for a particular ebook.

	#.	When a source is preceded by “the”, “the” is outside of the link to the source.

		.. class:: wrong

			.. code:: html

				<p>This particular ebook is based on digital scans available at <a href="IA_URL">the Internet Archive</a>.</p>

		.. class:: corrected

			.. code:: html

The half title page
*******************

#.	A half title page is included when there is front matter of any type in an ebook besides the titlepage and imprint.

#.	The half title page is located after the last item of front matter, before the body matter.

#.	The half title page has a :html:`<title>` element containing the full title of the ebook.

#.	The half title page contains one :html:`<section id="halftitlepage" epub:type="halftitlepage">` element, which in turn contains one :html:`<h1 epub:type="fulltitle">` element containing the full title of the ebook, including subtitles. The half title page is the only place where an :html:`<h1>` element may appear in a Standard Ebook.

#.	If the ebook has a subtitle, it is included in the half title page.

#.	The :value:`fulltitle` semantic is applied to the top-level heading element in the half title page. This is usually either :html:`<hgroup>` in works with subtitles or :html:`<h1>` in works without.

#.	Formatting for the :html:`<h1>` element follows patterns in `7.2.9 </manual/VERSION/7-high-level-structural-patterns#7.2.9>`__.

#.	A complete half title page looks like the following template:

	.. code:: html

		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
		<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" epub:prefix="z3998: http://www.daisy.org/z3998/2012/vocab/structure/, se: https://standardebooks.org/vocab/1.0" xml:lang="en-GB">

			<body epub:type="frontmatter">
				<section id="halftitlepage" epub:type="halftitlepage">
					<hgroup epub:type="fulltitle">
						<h1 epub:type="title">His Last Bow</h1>
						<h2 epub:type="subtitle">Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes</h2>
					</hgroup>
				</section>
			</body>
		</html>

The colophon
************

#.	The colophon is the second-to-last item in the ebook’s content flow.

#.	The colophon has a :html:`<title>` element with the value :string:`Colophon`.

#.	The half title page contains one :html:`<section id="colophon" epub:type="colophon">` element, which in turn contains one :html:`<header>` element with the Standard Ebooks logo, followed by a series of :html:`<p>` elements containing the colophon’s content.

Names
=====

#.	Within :html:`<p>` elements, proper names except for the book title and cover art title are wrapped in an :html:`<a>` element pointing to the name’s Wikipedia page, or to a link representing the name, like a personal homepage.

#.	If a name does not have a Wikipedia entry, the name is wrapped in :html:`<b class="name">`.

#.	Two names are separated by :string:`and`. Three or more names are separated by commas, with the final name separated by :string:`, and`. (I.e., with an Oxford comma.)

	.. class:: wrong

		.. code:: html

			<b class="name">Fritz Ohrenschall</b>, <b class="name">Sania Ali Mirza</b> and <a href="https://www.pgdp.net">The Online Distributed Proofreading Team</a>

#.	Any anonymous contributor is listed as :string:`An Anonymous Volunteer`.

Subsections
===========

#.	Subsections are represented by a :html:`<p>` element.

	#.	Within each :html:`<p>` element, a :html:`<br/>` element is placed before and after any proper name block. A proper name block may contain more than one name in a direct series (like a list of transcribers).

		.. code:: html

			<p><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Moon Pool</i><br/>
			was published in 1919 by<br/>

		#.	If the book has a translator, a translator block follows the author name in the same :html:`<p>` element. The translator block follows this formula: :string:`It was translated from LANGUAGE in YEAR by <a href="TRANSLATOR_WIKI_URL">TRANSLATOR</a>.`.

			.. code:: html

The Uncopyright
***************

Where traditionally published ebooks may contain a copyright page at the front of the ebook, Standard Ebooks contain an Uncopyright page at the end of the ebook.

#.	The Uncopyright page is the last item in the ebook’s content flow.

#.	The Uncopyright page follows the template created by :bash:`se create-draft` exactly.
